Commentary:
This lab was interesting to work on. The main difficulty was the integration of the different custom elements created. The most recent edition did not need any external imports outside of the given react library (such as the MIT color bar), but the lab felt like good practice for learning how to design components that can easily be integrated with others. Another component that was difficult for me was learning how to use React.useEffect() and setInterval() to handle different timing events. Two useEffects were used: one for the countdown timer and the other for collecting the user's guess from the RGB sliders.
